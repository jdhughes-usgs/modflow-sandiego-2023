              McDonald Valley Calibration Exercise -- Stage 2

   CALIBRATION FOR PREDEVELOPMENT CONDITIONS USING PRE-EXISTING INFORMATION


During this stage of the exercise you will calibrate your flow model for
predevelopment conditions using the existing information that we have
provided. Calibration involves selectively adjusting aspects of your model,
such as hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions, so that the simulated
results reproduce the observations as closely as possible. Remember not to
fall into the trap of treating calibration solely as a curve fitting
procedure. You should always try to adjust parameters within ranges that you
can justify based on what you know about the system and to avoid adjusting
parameters in ways that cannot be supported. That almost always means your
"calibrated" model will be less than perfect when you are finished.  However,
the calibration process can provide you with a great deal of insight into what
hydrologic features are really important in controlling the function of the
ground water system. You can use this insight to plan your field work so that
you will be able to obtain new data to fill in gaps in areas that are of
critical importance.

As you construct your calibrated model, keep the following things in mind:

1. What are the critical elements of the hydrology of the McDonald Valley
   ground water system that the model must reproduce?

2. To what parameters is the model most sensitive?

3. What are the critical gaps in information and what kind of data should be
   collected to fill those gaps.

Attached are some worksheets to help you summarize the results of your
calibration analysis.
