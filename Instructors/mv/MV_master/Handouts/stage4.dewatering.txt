                                Extra Run


The cooperator has asked you to evaluate one additional development option:


* The Reilly well pumps at -67,000 just as in the other cases.

* The Virginia City wells are removed.

* A dewatering operation is initiated at row 23, column 20. The head in 
  row 23, column 20 must be lowered to 2 feet above datum. 


Questions:

1. How much water must be pumped from row 23, column 20, layer 1 to keep the
head in that cell equal to 2?

2. What will the lake stage be for this situation?

 
HINT:  Use a drain with a high drain conductance in row 23, column 20, 
       layer 1.
